Basic data types are only the building blocks. Eventually, what you'll use in practice when solving real
life data analysis problems is collections of these data types. R has a wide variety of data types including Lists, Data frames, Vectors, Matrices, and Factors that come to your rescue in R.

### 5.1 Lists

List are recursive data types. They can contain all sorts of objects and they don't need to be of same type either. An ordered collection of objects. A list allows you to gather a variety of objects under one name.

```{r}
x = 1:10
y = rep(c("a","b","c"),each=5)
z = 5.90
list_1 = list(x,y,z)
list_1
```

Here is how to access individual list elements

```{r}
list_1 [[2]] 
```

Note the double bracket [[]] instead of single bracket [] used to access the indiviual list element of the list.

However, if you want to access the element of that particular individual list element. Lets say, to get third element of the second element of the above list we'd simply write:

```{r}
list_1 [[2]] [5]
```

If you find double bracket [[]] to be really cumbersome, you can name your list elements while creating the list.

```{r}
list_2 = list(num = x, char = y, val = z)
list_2
```

If you notice that now, instead of those [[]] indices you simply see $ signs with the name of elements. 

```{r}
list_2$char
```

To access 5th element of the 2nd element (named char) of this list:

```{r}
list_2$char[5]
```

So now you can also access list elements with single bracket []

### 5.2 Data Frames

Data frames are actually a special kind of list. They are list of vectors of equal length.

```{r}
states = c('delhi','andhra','kerala','maharashtra','karnataka','gujrat','tamilnadu','goa','punjab','Bengal','odisha')
languages = c('hindi','telugu','malayalam','marathi','kannad','gujrati','tamil','konkani','punjabi','bengali','odiya')
df = data.frame(states,languages)
df
```

You can view this data frame by typing in View(dataframe name) or simply clicking on the data set name in the 'Environment' window on top left.

```{r}
View(df)
```

To know the variable names of the data set

```{r}
names(df)
```

You can also use this to assign new variable names

```{r}
names(df) = c("state","lang")
df
```

This gives row names of the data set. It can be used to assign row names.

```{r}
rownames(df)
```

"dim" gives dimension of the data set in terms of number rows and columns. 

```{r}
dim(df)
```

You can get individual row numbers and column numbers using nrow and ncol.

```{r}
nrow(df)
```

```{r}
ncol(df)
```

"str" gives you a quick glimpse of the data in terms of variable names, their type and first few values.

```{r}
str(df)
```

How to access dataframes ? 

Lets say we want to get 3rd value in the 2nd column.

```{r}
df[3,2]
```

To access 3rd row, all columns

```{r}
df[3,]
```

All rows, 2nd colunmn

```{r}
df[,2]
```

### 5.3 Vectors

Vectors are most used collections of basic data types in R. An important property of the vectors is that they can contain only one type of basic data type, either numeric or character.

```{r}
vec = c(2,4,89,-10,5,6)
is.vector(x)
```

c means combine and it is a function.

If you do class(vector), result will be type of basic data type which the vector contains.

```{r}
class(vec)
```

#### 5.3.1 Accessing Vector Elements with Numerical Indices

You need to pass index numbers to access individual elements or subsets of the vector. Access a value insdie a vector using square brackets.

```{r}
vec[4]
```

If you want to access multiple elements, you can pass vector of indices.

```{r}
sub_vec = vec[c(1,3,5)]
is.vector(sub_vec)
```

Vector indices that you pass need not be in order or unique.

```{r}
vec[c(3,4,2,2,6,3)]
```

if index exceeds the number of elements in the vector, NA is returned as output.

```{r}
vec[c(2,3,8,5,4,9)]
```

One very important aspect of accessing vector elements with numerical indices is to pass -ve indices.

```{r}
vec
```

```{r}
vec[-2]
```

You can see that x[-2] gives you all elements of x except the second one. This is how you can exclude
elements from a vector.

If you pass a vector of indices and put a -ve sign in front of it.

```{r}
vec[-c(2,3,6)]
```

You can not pass positive and negative index for vector sub-setting. This will throw an error.

```{r}
vec[c(2,3,-1)]
```

#### 5.3.2 Accessing Vector Elements with Logical Indices

```{r}
vec
```

Lets create a logical vector here which takes values TRUE and FALSE for corresponding elements
of vec. For elements where condition > 4 is true, x takes value TRUE otherwise FALSE

```{r}
x = vec > 4
x
```

Now if you use this logical vector for sub-setting, output will get only those elements for which x takes value TRUE.

```{r}
vec[x]
```

You can directly put in the condition as well.

```{r}
vec[vec > 4]
```

You can negate or, flip a condition by putting a **!** sign infront of it.

```{r}
vec
```

```{r}
x
```

```{r}
!x
```

```{r}
vec[!x]
```

#### 5.3.3 Some Handy ways of creating a vector

If we want to create a vector containing numbers from x to y with increment 1, we can simply write x:y

```{r}
z = 5:15
z
```

we can use function **seq** to generate a vector using a arithmetic sequence as well

```{r}
x = seq(2,7, by = 0.8)
x
```



### 5.4 Matrices

Matrices are very much similar to your dataframes, exactly the same like dataframe, only difference is, that the matrix can hold only one type of data i.e. all the rows and columns can be either numbers or characters not numbers and characters.

Matrix is useful when you know that there are only numbers and majorly matrix comes handy for the purpose of doing some algorithmic calculations. In that sense, matrix is the best data structure to be used. 

This will fill the matrix column wise

```{r}
matx = matrix(c(4,7,3,8,5,9), nrow = 2, ncol = 3)
matx
```

This will fill the matrix row wise

```{r}
matx = matrix(c(4,7,3,8,5,9), nrow = 2, ncol = 3, byrow = TRUE)
matx
```

To convert matrix into dataframe

```{r}
as.data.frame(matx)
```

Accessing matrix is exactly similar as dataframes

To access row names and column names of a matrix

```{r}
dimnames(matx)
```

To change the column names and row names of a matrix, we use

```{r}
dimnames(matx) = list(c("row1","row2"), c("col1","col2","col3"))
```

To access the elements of a matrix

```{r}
matx[1,2]
```

```{r}
matx["row2","col3"]
```

### 5.5 Factors

Conceptually, factors are variables in R which take on a limited number of different values, such variables are often refered to as categorical variables. One of the most important uses of factors is in statistical modeling, since categorical variables enter into statistical models differently than continuous variables, storing data as factors insures that the modeling functions will treat such data correctly.

```{r}
season = c("winter","fall","summer","fall","autmn","summer","winter","fall","autmn","summer","winter")

print(season)
print(is.factor(season))

factor_season = factor(season)

print(factor_season)
print(is.factor(factor_season))
```

### 5.6 Arrays

**Arrays** are the R data objects which can store data in more than two dimensions. Arrays can store only one data type.

For example, If we create an array of dimension (2, 3, 4) then it creates 4 rectangular matrices each with 2 rows and 3 columns. 

An array is created using the **array()** function. It takes **vectors as input** and uses the values in the **dim** parameter to create an array.

**Example**:

The following example creates an array of two 4 x 4 matrices each with 4 rows and 4 columns.

```{r}
# Create two vectors of different lengths

vector1 = c(4,8,9,2)
vector2 = c(11,12,13,14,21,22,23,24,31,32,33,34)

# Take these vectors as input to the array

result = array(c(vector1,vector2), dim = c(4,4,2))
print(result)
```

#### 5.6.1 Accessing Array Elements

Lets see how we can access the array elements.

```{r}
vector1 = c(4,8,9,2)
vector2 = c(11,12,13,14,21,22,23,24,31,32,33,34)

result = array(c(vector1,vector2), dim = c(4,4,2))

# Print the third row of the second matrix of the array

print(result[3,,2])

# Print the element in the 1st row and 3rd column of the 1st matrix

print(result[1,3,1])

# Print the 2nd matrix

print(result[,,2])
```

#### 5.6.2 Manipulating Array Elements

As array is made up matrices in multiple dimensions, the **operations on elements** of array are carried out by accessing elements of the matrices.

```{r}
vector1 = c(5,9,3)
vector2 = c(10,11,12,13,14,15)

array1 = array(c(vector1,vector2), dim = c(3,3,2))

# Create two vectors of different lengths

vector3 = c(9,1,0)
vector4 = c(6,0,11,3,14,1,2,6,9)

array2 = array(c(vector1,vector2), dim = c(3,3,2))

# create matrices from these arrays

matrix1 = array1[,,2]
matrix2 = array2[,,2]

# Add the matrices

result = matrix1 + matrix2
print(result)
```

#### 5.6.3 Naming Columns and Rows

We can give **names** to the **rows**, **columns** and **matrices** in the array by using the **dimnames** parameter.

```{r}
vector1 = c(4,8,9,2)
vector2 = c(11,12,13,14,21,22,23,24,31,32,33,34)

column.names = c("Col1","Col2","Col3","Col4")

row.names = c("Row1","Row2","Row3","Row4")

matrix.names = c("Matrix1","Matrix2")

# Take these vectors as input to the array

result = array(c(vector1,vector2), dim = c(4,4,2), dimnames = list(row.names, column.names, matrix.names))
print(result)
```

#### 5.6.4 Calculations across Array Elements

We can do calculations across the elements in an array using the **apply()** function.

**Syntax**: ```apply(x, margin, fun)```

Following is the **description** of the **parameters** used:

```x``` is an array.

```margin``` is the name of the data set used.

```fun``` is the function to be applied across the elements of the array.

**Example**:

We use the ```apply()``` function below to **calculate the sum of the elements** in the rows of an array across all the matrices.

```{r}
vector1 = c(5,9,3)
vector2 = c(10,11,12,13,14,15)

new.array = array(c(vector1,vector2), dim = c(3,3,2))
print(new.array)

# Use apply to calculate the sum of the rows across all the matrices

result = apply(new.array, c(1), sum)
print(result)
```
