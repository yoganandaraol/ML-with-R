### 2.1 A digression on data types

Datatype is defined as the type of data that the object is holding. Different data types are **Numeric**, **Character**, **Integer**, and **Logical**.

**Logical**:

<center>

![](`r "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/insaid2018/R/master/images/logical.jpg"`)

</center>

```{r}
c(TRUE,FALSE)
```

**Numeric**:

<center>

![](`r "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/insaid2018/R/master/images/numeric.png"`)

</center>

```{r}
c(4,8)
```

**Integer**:

```{r}
c(1L,2L)
```

If you want a number to be integer then you have to specify capital **'L'** next to the number.  

**Character**:

<center>

![](`r "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/insaid2018/R/master/images/character.jpg"`)

</center>

```{r}
c("Hi!", "Welcome to INSAID")
```

How do you tell which of these types you have? Use the **"typeof"** function:

```{r}
typeof(c(TRUE,FALSE))
```

```{r}
typeof(c(4,8))
```

**'Double'** is a real number stored in a double-precision floating point format. 

A double type can store the special values Inf, -Inf, and NaN, which represent a positive infinity, a negative infinity, and a not a number.

```{r}
1/0
```

```{r}
-1/0
```

```{r}
0/0
```

```{r}
typeof(c(1L,2L))
```

```{r}
typeof(c("Hi!", "Welcome to INSAID"))
```

### 2.2 Hierarchy of data types

1. Character
2. Numeric
3. Integer
4. Logical

According to the **hierarchy of a datatype**, you can convert the number into a character which means it will just put that number into double quotes.

```{r}
x = 5.95
```

```{r}
typeof(x)
```

```{r}
y = as.character(x)
```

```{r}
y
```

```{r}

typeof(y)
```

But, you cannot convert a character into the numeric. That's how the hierarchy of the data types is defined.

```{r}
a = "Insaid"
```

```{r}
typeof(a)
```

```{r}
b = as.numeric(a)
```

```{r}
b
```

```{r}
typeof(b)
```

Both **'mode'** and **'storage.mode'** tells you the internal storage mode of the object.

```{r}
mode(x)
```

```{r}
storage.mode(x)
```

```{r}
mode(y)
```

```{r}
storage.mode(y)
```

### 2.3 Conversion between data types

R will try to convert from one mode to another as context demands. Remember that every element of a vector needs to have same mode. 

As a result, if you insert a character value into a numeric vector, the whole vector will be changed to character. 

These automatic conversions will always be from a more specific mode to a more general one: logical to double, and either of those to character.

```{r}
# create a string of double-precision values
dbl_var = c(1, 2.5, 4.5)  
dbl_var
```

```{r}
typeof(dbl_var)
```

```{r}
# placing an L after the values creates a string of integers
int_var = c(1L, 6L, 10L)
int_var
```

```{r}
typeof(int_var)
```

```{r}
# converts integers to double-precision values
con_int_var =  as.double(int_var)     
```

```{r}
con_int_var
```

```{r}
typeof(con_int_var)
```

```{r}
# identical to as.double()
iden_int_var = as.numeric(int_var)    
```

```{r}
iden_int_var
```

```{r}
typeof(iden_int_var)
```

```{r}
# converts doubles to integers
con_dbl_var = as.integer(dbl_var)         
```

```{r}
con_dbl_var
```

```{r}
typeof(con_dbl_var)
```

___

Often, you dont need to worry too much about the types, because R will implicitly convert between types for you. 

For example, When the first line gets executed, x gets created as an integer vector. In the second line, R converts x to a double vector so that it can store the value 3.14

```{r}
x = 1:10
```

```{r}
x
```

```{r}
typeof(x)
```

```{r}
x[[2]] = 3.14
```

```{r}
x
```

```{r}
typeof(x)
```
